---------------------------------------
### Description

- Several different characters exhibit substantially different behaviours.
- Movement relies in steering behaviours
- Each character's behaviour is dictated by a FSM.

### Additional Objectives

- [] One of the characters is not an individual but a block of 30 boids minimum.
- [] One of the FSMs is 2-level HFSM.

-------------
- [] There's a "new" steering behavoiur (neither shown in class nor in any exercise) that you have implemented yourselves. If that steering is not your own, cite the sources.
- [] If one of the FSMs is a (3+)-level HFSM.
- [] If your scene includes some type of user interaction (it might not be complex but it should allow the user some control on what's happening in the scene).

### Delivery Rules

- The Unity project with the scene and all the required scripts, resources, etc. 
- A REPORT including o A Brief description of the scene (what’s in there, how the characters are expected to behave, how the user can interact with the scene -if they can- …).
- - A clear enumeration of the extras included.
- - The diagrams of all FSMs (and HSFMs) 
- -  A full specification of, at least, the most complex FSM (the one with more transitions).
- - - For each state: enter, exit and in-state actions.
- - - For each transition: triggering condition and transition action.
- - The algorithm (not the code) of any new steering behaviour (if any).
- - BEWARE: inexistent or low-quality report gives negative marks (-10, -20, -30...).
